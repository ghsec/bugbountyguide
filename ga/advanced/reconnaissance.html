    <h3>Reconnaissance</h3>
    <p>So if you are reading this I assume you are already finding issues and have a fairly basic reconnaissance methodology. This section will focus on unusual and often left-out steps during reconnaissance.</p>

    <h4>Content Security Policies</h4>
    <p>Content Security Policies (CSP) are commonly used to prevent client-side code injection from being exploitable. What many do not realise is that they are also a wealth of knowledge about the target and its dependencies. I suggest you start actively monitoring CSPs on targets in real time for any changes and potential (sub-)domain takeovers.</p>

    <pre><code>$ curl -I --silent http://example.com | grep Content-Security-Policy
$ curl -I --silent http://example.com | grep "script-src\|style-src"</code></pre>

	<h4>Broken links</h4>
	<p>As described in <i><a href="https://edoverflow.com/2017/broken-link-hijacking/">"Broken Link Hijacking - How expired links can be exploited."</a></i>, if a target is importing resources from an expired endpoint, you might be able to claim it and execute client-side script on the target's page. Use <i><a href="https://github.com/stevenvachon/broken-link-checker">broken-link-checker</a></i> and check the browser's console for errors.</p>

	<pre><code>$ blc -rfoi --filter-level 3 https://example.com/ | grep "Getting\|BROKEN"</code></pre>

	<h4>Google BigQuery</h4>
	<p>Google's <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/">BigQuery</a> can process large quantities of data extremely quickly. This tool can easily be integrated to search the whole of GitHub's public code bases in a couple of minutes.</p>

	<h4>Physical reconnaissance</h4>
	<p>Yes, I am not kidding — purely hypothetical at this point — but why not try getting hold of physical products created by the target and seeing if you can extract valuable information?</p>
